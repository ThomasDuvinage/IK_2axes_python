If you want to run the code you need to dowload the csv file or generate it by uncommented #all_positions(theta1s, theta2s, fx, fy) at the end of the code

You've got differents functions in this code :

all_positions --> permit to generate/calculate all the positions the robot arm can have. It generate a csv file.

ask_position --> allowed you to know the best angles for the positons, calculate with the matrix for the upper step.

It work fine but it's long.

So I write a csv reader, which do exclatly the same things but faster.
